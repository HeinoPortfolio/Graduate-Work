# Graduate-Work

The table below is the order that the courses were taken in.  The listing above does not reflect the order that they were taken.  Some directories may be empty.  The reason for this is that they have not been completed yet and they are in the process of being completed.  The appropriate content will be uploaded at that time.

**Note:** This directory is still a work and progress and will be completed at a later date.

**Additional Graduate Work**

You will find additional work from my master's degree in data analytic and computer science. **Note:**  The master's in computer science repo is only available via request and only for the purposes of job interview and othe similar events.  This is to uphold the univeristy's policy on public exhibtion of coursework.  This can be made available only by request during the job interview process.
