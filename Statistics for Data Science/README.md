**Assignment**|**Description of Assignment**
:-----:|:-----:
Drill 1 |  Construct a frequency distribution and a histogram. Find the percentage of observations within one standard deviation of the mean. Use the selling price for analysis.
Drill 2 | Based on a descriptive graphic, describe the shape of the sample data distribution. Find and interpret point estimates of the population, mean, and standard deviation. Construct a 95% confidence interval for Î¼, using R software. Conduct a descriptive statistical analysis using graphs and numerical summaries. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population mean weight changes for the family therapy and the control.
Drill 3 |Form the scatter plot of y and x1. Then answer, does the normal GLM structure of constant variability in y seem appropriate? If not, how does it seem to be violated? Using the identity link function, fit the: i) normal GLM ii) gamma GLM iii) For each model, interpret the effect of x2. 
Drill 4 |Fit a KNN classification model to the wine data, using pH, alcohol, fixed.acidity, and residual.sugar as explanatory variables. Evaluate its performance using 10-fold cross-validation, using AUC to choose the best k. 
Project 4 |  Try to recreate with R or Octave, as close as possible, the data from figure P4p4F1.pdf. Functions needed are: runif (R) for uniform distribution and rnorm (R) for normal distribution.
